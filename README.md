# **Pokedex**

Welcome to the Pokedex Web App, a straightforward web application crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app seamlessly gathers data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and presents a catalog of Pokémon, complete with their names, numbers, types, and images.

The application boasts a convenient "Load More" button, enabling users to fetch additional Pokémon from the API in sets of 10. The maximum number of Pokémon retrievable is capped at 150.

**Getting Started**

To experience this app, all you need to do is open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The app will load and promptly exhibit a comprehensive list of Pokémon.

**Dependencies**

This application relies on a couple of external resources:

* [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/): This CSS file enhances browser rendering consistency and ensures elements conform to modern standards.
* [Roboto Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto): A sans-serif font family, meticulously designed by Christian Robertson, and released by Google as a part of the Android operating system.

**File Structure**

Here's an overview of the key files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the application.
* `assets/css/global.css`: A CSS file containing global styles that affect the entire application.
* `assets/css/pokedex.css`: A CSS file tailored to style the Pokedex section of the app.
* `assets/js/main.js`: The primary JavaScript file that houses the code for fetching and presenting Pokémon data.
* `assets/js/poke-api.js`: A JavaScript file dedicated to interfacing with the PokeAPI.
* `assets/js/pokemon-model.js`: A JavaScript file defining the `Pokemon` class, instrumental in the app's functionality.

**Acknowledgments**

This application was crafted as part of a coding challenge by [digitalinnovationone](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone) and drew inspiration from a variety of Pokedex apps and websites.
